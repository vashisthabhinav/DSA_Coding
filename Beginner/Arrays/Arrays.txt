An Array is a collection of items.
The items could be integers, strings, etc.
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations.
Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.
On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items.
The value of N is decided by the programmer, at the time to create the Array.
